#  Randyn Collins Javascript-quiz


## Description
This project was built to test my knowledge and skills on Javascript as well as some CSS in there . I have learned more about if else statements and how useful they can be. This project tested my knowledge on timers. Though still not great it did force me to understand them better and to do my own research to get them operating correctly. I learned how important it is to keep your code in order and how one little mistake can keep the entire code from working correctly. This project can help you understand setting up buttons with event listeners as well as having a very minimal html and doing everything inside your JS file.
